### How do I suggest something?

The first thing you will need to do is find the #suggestions channel in the Discord. Next you will make sure that your suggestion has not been suggested before. You can see if your suggestion has been requested by either reading the channel or you can use the search feature in the top right of your screen. If it has not been suggested then you will type the following message `!suggest [Suggestion]` For example `!suggest A guide on how to use Discord`. When you send the message a new message will appear with your suggestion where users can upvote or downvote your suggestion.



If there is something that is not listed in this guide but you cannot figure out you can head over to Discords support center [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us) where they have resources to help you. (Or you can suggest to edit this guide)
