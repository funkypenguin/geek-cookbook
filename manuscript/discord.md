In order to start using discord you will need to join your first server, You can join a server by clicking on the green + and clicking join a server, From there it will ask for the servers invite code, The invite code for Funky Penguins discord is [Here](https://discord.gg/R2NH7kZ). Once you join the server you will be presented with rooms called “Channels” When you click on a channel you will be able to start talking in that channel and everyone in the server will be able to talk to you. If you want to get the attention of a specific user you are able to poke (Formally known as a “mention”) By initially typing @ and then the username of the user so for example if you want to poke funky penguin you will type @funkypenguin Hello. When you start typing the username you will see names appearing above the text box, If you see the user you can click on the name and it will automatically type their name


**What If I want to privately talk to someone?**

In order to privately message someone you will first need to find the user on the members list (The list of people on the right). Once you find the person you will click on their name and you will see a text field saying “Message @user” From there you will start typing your message and when you are happy with your message you will click enter.

**Discord Markdown**
Discord supports markdown, If you are unaware of what markdown is markdown allows you to change the style of your message for example you can bold your message or you can underline it. If you want to learn how to use markdown you can read one of the guides that discord made on how to use markdown: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-
