## A Beginners Guide to Discord


### Why do we use discord?

We use discord because we feel that it is the easiest way for the geeky community to be able to communicate with each other without any hassle, Discord supports markdown so you can make your sentences bold, italic, underlined, you can automate many tasks on discord for example when a change is made to the github repo it automaticlly posts to discord. 

### How do I join the discord server?

### Discord Rules
Everyone must behave correctly on the Discord so we have some rules that users must follow.

1. Please do not spam in any channel. Spamming is classed as sending the same message 3+ Times in a short timespan.
2. Please be respectful to all users.
3. Please do not advertise unless you are in the #advertisements channel


### How to get help.

If you need assistance at any time while on the discord server you can post a message in #general and say what you need help with. Please make sure you say what you are having issues with. Do not just say "I need help" Once you have posted your message one of the friendly community member will assist you when they can.


### How Do I invite other people.

If you want to send your friends a link to the discord server there are two ways that you can do so. The most easiest way is you can send them [This Link](http://chat.funkypenguin.co.nz) Or you can right click on the discord server and click "Invite People"

### How do I suggest something?

The first thing you will need to do is find the #suggestions channel in the discord. Next you will make sure that your suggestion has not been suggested before, if it has not been suggested then you will type the following message `!suggest [Suggestion]` For example `!suggest A guide on how to use discord`. When you send the message a new message will appear with your suggestion where users can upvote or downvote your suggestion.



If there is something that is not listed in this guide but you cannot figure out you can head over to discords support center [Here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us) Where they have resources to help you. (Or you can suggest to edit this guide)
