# What is this?

The "**[Geek's Cookbook](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz)**" is a collection of guides for establishing your own highly-available docker container cluster (swarm). This swarm enables you to run self-hosted services such as [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com), etc.

## Who is this for?

You already have a familiarity with concepts such as [virtual](https://libvirt.org/) [machines](https://www.virtualbox.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers, [LetsEncrypt SSL certificates](https://letsencrypt.org/), databases, and command-line interfaces.

You've probably played with self-hosting some mainstream apps yourself, like [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), [OwnCloud](https://owncloud.org/), [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) or even [SandStorm](https://sandstorm.io/).

## Why should I read this?

So if you're familiar enough with the tools, and you've done self-hosting before, why would you read this book?

1. You want to upskill. You want to do container orchestration, LetsEncrypt certificates, git collaboration.
2. You want to play. You want a safe sandbox to test new tools, keeping the ones you want and tossing the ones you don't.
3. You want reliability. Once you go from __playing__ with a tool to actually __using__ it, you want it to be available when you need it. Having to "_quickly ssh into the host and restart the webserver_" doesn't cut it when your wife wants to know why her phone won't sync!

## What do you want from me?

I want your money.

No, seriously (_but yes, I do want your money - see below_), If the above applies to you, then you're like me. I want everything I wrote above, so I ended up learning all this as I went along. I enjoy it, and I'm good at it. So I created this website, partly to make sure I documented my own setup properly.

## How can I support you?
