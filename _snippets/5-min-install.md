## The easy, 5-minute install

I share (_with [sponsors][github_sponsor] and [patrons][patreon]_) a private "_premix_" GitHub repository, which includes an ansible playbook for deploying the entire Geek's Cookbook stack, automatically. This means that members can create the entire environment with just a ```git pull``` and an ```ansible-playbook deploy.yml``` üëç
