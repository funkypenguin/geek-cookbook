    I share (_with my [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/funkypenguin)_) a private "[_premix_](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/premix/)" git repository, which includes necessary docker-compose and env files for all published recipes. This means that sponsors can launch any recipe with just a `git pull` and a `docker stack deploy` 👍. 

    🚀 **Update**: Premix now includes an ansible playbook, so that sponsors can deploy an entire stack + recipes, with a single ansible command! (*more [here](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/premix/ansible/operation/)*)
